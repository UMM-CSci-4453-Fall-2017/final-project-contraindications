WHAT: 

A contraindication checker website that allows you to check for contraindications in your medication. Contraindications suggest that while taking your current medications or under your current conditions there may be complications.

Users will select medications they are taking or conditions they fall under from dropdown lists (they can also type to search the dropdown). Then the site will check our database to see if their medication/conditions conflict (have contraindications).
